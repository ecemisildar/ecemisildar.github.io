#### Drone Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning
The drone agent learns how to collect goal points in a custom environment in the Gazebo using the DDPG algorithm and image observation.

#### Path Planning with Rosbot
This project aims to integrate the ROSPlan package, which uses the PDDL language, to define a plan for a robot with a camera mounted on it to detect four markers autonomously in an environment with obstacles (e.g.: walls). The world environment and the robot model are already given. Simulation and real-world tests are done successfully by the group members.
The global planner used by the MoveBase package is Dijkstra’s algorithm 
The algorithm used for mapping was based on Gmapping

#### Vision Guided Marker Reach Robot

This project aims to use a robot with a camera mounted on it to detect the four markers and reach them when at least 200 pixels are detected by the camera. The world environment and the robot model are already given. Therefore, a controller node is written then simulation and real-world tests are done successfully by the group members.

#### ITU Rover Team
I participated in this project team during my bachelor's. This team aims to develop a Mars Rover with autonomous driving, robotic arm and sample collection parts for the University Rover Challenge and European Rover Challenge.

#### Pick and Place Robot 
This project aims to pick and move all the silver tokens and release them next to the golden token in pygame environment. The robot also understands that the task is completed when all the tokens are in pairs. The code is written in python. The initial point of the robot is not important, and this code can be applied to all initial points.
